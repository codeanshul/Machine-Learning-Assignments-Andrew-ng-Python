### Documenting my python implementation of Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course

[Linear Regression](https://github.com/Benlau93/Machine-Learning-by-Andrew-Ng-in-Python/tree/master/LinearRegression)

1. Implemented linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a food truck.

2. Implemented linear regression with multiple variables to predict the prices of houses.

<br/>

[Logistic Regression](https://github.com/Benlau93/Machine-Learning-by-Andrew-Ng-in-Python/tree/master/LogisticRegression)

1. Build a classification model that estimates an applicant's probability of admission based the scores from those two exams.

2. Build a classification model that determine whether the microchips should be accepted or rejected based on two different test scores. <br/>

[Neural Networks](https://github.com/Benlau93/Machine-Learning-by-Andrew-Ng-in-Python/tree/master/NeuralNetworks) 

1.Build a Logistic regression and neural networks to recognize handwritten digits (from 0 to 9).

<br/>
[Bias Vs Variance](https://github.com/Benlau93/Machine-Learning-by-Andrew-Ng-in-Python/tree/master/Bias_Vs_Variance) 

1. Implemented concepts of regularized linear regression, bias/ variance , polynomial regression to predict the amount of water flowing out of a dam using the change of water level in a reservoir.
 
<br/>
[Support Vector Machines](https://github.com/Benlau93/Machine-Learning-by-Andrew-Ng-in-Python/tree/master/SupportVectorMachines) 

1. Implemented support vector machine algorithm from scratch.

2. Used support vector machine to build SPAM classifier.

<br/>
[Unsupervised Learning](https://github.com/Benlau93/Machine-Learning-by-Andrew-Ng-in-Python/tree/master/KmeansClustering_PCA) 

1. implemented k means clustering algorithm in python from scratch.

2. Used the K-means algorithm for image compression by reducing the number of colors that occur in an image to only those that are most common in that image.

<br/>
[Anomaly Detection and Recommender system](https://github.com/Benlau93/Machine-Learning-by-Andrew-Ng-in-Python/tree/master/Anomaly%20Detection) 

1. Implemented an anomaly detection algorithm to detect anomalous behavior in server computers. The features measure the through-put (mb/s) and latency (ms) of response of each server.

2.  Implemented the collaborative filtering learning algorithm and apply it to a dataset of movie ratings.
